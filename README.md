## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used for any election by modifying the file name and path. As long as the format of the election results are consistent with this election results data then this script can be used to analyze any election. Another way to modify this script to be used for another election is by adding a new variable to load a file from a path and then setting initializing new variables for the new election data.
